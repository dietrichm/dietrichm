### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an independent software engineer and agile coach at [BjiÃ¨n](https://bjien.be/), where I help SaaS startups and scaleups take engineering to the next level.

My key skills are SaaS development, Test-Driven Development (TDD), Domain-Driven Design (DDD), agile methodologies (Lean/XP/Kanban/Scrum), Python, Go, and PHP.

I sometimes write about company and team agility, software engineering, startups, and related subjects.
